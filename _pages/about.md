Hi there! I'm **Qiang YuDong**, a master's student in **Control Science and Engineering** at **Northwestern Polytechnical University**. My research interests focus on **reinforcement learning** and **UAV path planning**.

I have hands-on experience with tools such as **Python**, **MATLAB**, **LaTeX**, and **AirSim**, and Iâ€™ve participated in several projects related to **intelligent fault diagnosis**. I'm passionate about bridging theory and practice to solve real-world problems in autonomous systems.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on applying **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Imitation Learning (IL)** in **drone navigation and control**.  
Feel free to connect if you share similar interests!
