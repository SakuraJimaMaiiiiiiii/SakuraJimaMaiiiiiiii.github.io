## Abstract:
This paper focuses on the extraction of high-fidelity fault signatures in rolling bearings using a novel nonconvex regularized sparse representation method. The approach is enhanced by a flexible analytical wavelet transform, providing a more accurate and reliable fault detection mechanism in industrial applications. The study shows significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
